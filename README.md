Optimization of Green Fresh Food Logistics with Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Route Problem by Genetic Algorithm

The purpose of this project is to develop an optimal distribution route for the fresh food logistics
considering the reduction of total distribution cost. The distribution cost includes the following:
* fixed cost
* fuel consumption cost
* refrigeration cost
* overtime cost
* carbon emission cost
* damage cost
